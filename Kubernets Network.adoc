Kubernetes Network
==================

Kubernetes Network, the hard part.

Pod

Pod is an atomic unit wraps one or more containers, which can be replicated, scaled up and down in Kubernetes.

Node
----

A node is a computing resource in Kubernetes.

Cluster
-------

Hivemind like abstract layer pooling nodes together to form a more powerful CPU and RAM resources.

Persistent Volumes
------------------

Persistent Volumes provide a network file system that can be mounted to the cluster without being associated with any particular node.


Network
=======

- All containers should communicate with each other without NAT (Network Address Translation)
- All nodes should communicate with all containers without NAT (Network Address Translation)
- The IP as seen by one container is the same as seen by the other container (in other words, Kubernetes bans any IP masquerading)
- Pods can communicate regardless of what Node they sit on

Ingress
-------

Ingress opens up a channel to communicate with services running on Pods which isolated from outside world.

Service
-------
